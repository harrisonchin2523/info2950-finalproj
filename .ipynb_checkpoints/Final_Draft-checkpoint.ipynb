    "# Research Question(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of our project is to provide useful insights about in-flight services that an airline can use to improve customer satisfaction. To do this, we will investigate three key questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Are there differences in ratings across different categories based on whether the customer is loyal or disloyal?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How do ratings or satisfactions change depending on the type of travel? (Business travel vs Personal Travel)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How do ratings change between business and economy class passengers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions could help an airline identify what inflight services they want to improve for which kind of customer. For example, if it appears that business class passengers are very satisfied with food but economy class passengers are not, then an airline could focus on improving economy class food. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to create a model that will predict customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction based on various characteristics of the customer ahead of time. It is possible that if this model were put into place, then airlines could see what customers are likely to be dissatisfied and focus more efforts on making sure they are happy with the inflight services. A successful implementation of this concept could cause passengers who are not easy to please to be further inclined to use this airline again, thereby increasing profits. "

    "# Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the airline dataset that we have chosen, our observations are passengers who have filled out a satisfaction survey and the attributes are various characteristics of the passengers rating the flight, the flight itself, a rating from 1-5 in terms of satisfaction for various inflight and out of flight services, and a classification of the passenger as either “satisfied” or “neutral/dissatisfied”. The characteristics of the passengers rating the flight are Gender, Customer Type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer), and Age. The characteristics of the flight are Type of Travel (Personal Travel, Business Travel), Class (The Seat Class; Business, Eco, Eco Plus), Flight distance, Departure Delay in Minutes (Minutes delayed when departing), and Arrival Delay in Minutes (Minutes delayed when arriving). The services the passengers are rating are Inflight wifi service, Departure/Arrival time convenience, Ease of Online booking, Gate location, Food and drink, Online boarding, Seat comfort, Inflight entertainment, On-board service, Leg room service, Baggage handling, Check-in service, Inflight service, and Cleanliness."

    "## Reasoning for Removing Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to remove columns that did not pertain to the inflight aspect of the airline as we suspect that these categories are not something that the airline can necessarily completely control on their own. Our goal is to help airlines pinpoint categories that they can improve on and raise satisfaction ratings overall and we believe that an airline can change the most within their own aircraft and the services they provide within it. So, I used the built-in pandas drop function to drop the columns that we didn’t need. Specifically, we dropped  'Departure/Arrival time convenient', 'Ease of Online booking', 'Gate location', 'Online boarding', 'Baggage handling', 'Checkin service',   'Departure Delay in Minutes', 'Arrival Delay in Minutes', 'Unnamed: 0'. \n",

    "\n",
    "We wanted to remove short to mid distance flights when considering satisfaction levels because longer distance flights will cause more categories to aggravate customers as they are on the plane longer than usual. Short to mid distance flights constitute flights that are less than 3000 miles long or about 6 hours long or less. This will expose the weaknesses that airlines have within their flights and will help them realize what they need to improve. In addition, the lower the chance that customers will feel less satisfied with certain categories because they are on the plane for a shorter time. By focusing on the longer flights and removing shorter distance flights, we can create better predictions on satisfaction levels of customers. We did this by using a SQL query to filter flights that had distances greater than or equal to 3000 to create a new data frame that we would use for our data analysis."

For example, if two people feel the same absolute satisfaction about something, it is still possible that they rate that attribute of their flight differently. Additionally, something that is extremely displeasing to one passenger could be just a minor inconvenience to another, so expectations and mood also play into this survey. Other factors could influence the ratings as well. For example, if someone usually flies economy class and flies business class because someone else pays for them, then they might rate services higher or lower just because they are used to different ones. The classification of customers also falls into only two categories: “satisfied” and “neutral or dissatisfied,” which are not very specifically reflective of someone’s experience. Additionally, for the larger goal of our project to help airlines improve customer satisfaction, this dataset only pertains to one airline and is therefore less generalizable, but our project could help an airline see what customers value. \n"
